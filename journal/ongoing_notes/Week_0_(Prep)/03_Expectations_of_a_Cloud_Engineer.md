- Research independently before seeking guidance.

**Avoid Working in Silos:**

- Strive for unified thinking and implement solutions as a team.
- Avoid pursuing isolated paths; instead, align with project and team conventions.
- It's essential to uphold shared standards, as collaboration usually yields better outcomes.

**Learning and Collaboration:**

- Team members come from diverse backgrounds and skills; leverage this diversity for better outcomes.
- Learn from each other's strengths and avoid dismissing someone because they lack a specific skill.
