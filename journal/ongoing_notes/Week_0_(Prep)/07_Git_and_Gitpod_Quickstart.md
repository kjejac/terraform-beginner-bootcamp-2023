# Setting up Gitpod
1. Referring to a video of setting up Gitpod, no video available in the LMS. Shala posted a link to a video.
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh9kz9Sh1T8
   Created an account based on that information, linked to my Github account
2. In Git-Pod, add settings for public_repo ![](media/Pasted_image_20230918142146.png)
3. Install the Git-Pod browser extension so the button in Github shows up ![](media/Pasted_image_20230918142236.png)
4. Open project with the Gitpod button, edit in Gitpod VSC, notice the Git change ![](media/Pasted_image_20230918150207.png)
5. Commit with comment describing what was changed
6. Sync Changes
7. Changes will now be in Github ![](media/Pasted_image_20230918150538.png)
8. Changes made in Github will be synced to Gitpod, but need to use the git command to sync
   ```sh
   git pull
   ```
9. The Github repository is the "Source of truth"
